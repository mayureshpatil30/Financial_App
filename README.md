**Financial_App

 the front-end of a sample financial app by integrating real-time data visualization using Perspective. This visualization will help JPMorgan Chase teams to better understand financial data trends and make informed decisions.

Steps to Complete Task 2:
Set Up Perspective Workspace:

Import the Perspective library, which is typically provided in the codebase.
Familiarize yourself with Perspective’s API to understand how to interact with the grid and handle updates.
Render Real-Time Data in Perspective:

Connect the application to a data source that simulates stock price data.
Use Perspective to create a table with this data, rendering it in a grid format. You may need to use JSON data or simulate streaming data.
Update the grid in real time, so changes in the stock data are immediately visible.
Implement Graphs and Visualizations:

Using Perspective’s visualization tools, render data in different formats, such as line charts or bar charts.
Customize the views based on provided requirements, such as filtering, grouping, or sorting data.
Integrate the Visualization into the Existing App:

Ensure the Perspective grid or chart is responsive and integrates well within the application's UI.
Test for functionality, ensuring data refreshes at regular intervals and displays correctly without manual intervention.
Test and Debug:

Run your app to verify that the data visualization component works as expected and updates in real time.
Ensure error handling is in place, particularly around data fetching and rendering.
Documentation and Comments:

Add comments to your code to explain key parts of your implementation.
Make sure to document any changes to the codebase and describe your approach to integrating Perspective.
Key Tools & Skills:
JavaScript (ES6): Familiarity with JavaScript, as well as with Promises and asynchronous data handling.
Perspective API: Understanding of Perspective’s tables and views for data visualization.
HTML/CSS: Basic front-end skills to integrate the visualization into the application’s layout.
Key Concepts in Perspective:
Table: Represents data in a structured format. You’ll use this to handle the incoming stock data.
View: Used to manipulate and display data in different visual formats (grid, charts).
Updates: Real-time handling of data updates using Perspective’s subscription model.
